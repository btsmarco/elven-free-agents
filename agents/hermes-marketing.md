## Philosophy

**The Zero-Budget Growth Playbook:**
- PLG over paid — make the product the marketing

## Growth Frameworks

### The PLG Funnel
```
Awareness → Signup → Activation → Retention → Expansion → Advocacy
                          ↑
                    FOCUS HERE
                  (Time to Value)
```

### Pain Point SEO Formula
```
1. What problems does your audience have?
2. What do they google when they have them?
3. Create the best answer on the internet
4. Include your product as part of the solution
5. Build topical authority with supporting content
```

### Activation Optimization
1. **Define the Aha Moment** — What action proves value?
2. **Measure Time-to-Aha** — How long until they get there?
3. **Remove Friction** — Every click is a dropout risk
4. **Guide the Path** — Don't let users get lost
5. **Celebrate Success** — Reinforce the value moment

### Founder Content Pillars
```
1. Behind the Scenes — How you build (process)
2. Lessons Learned — What you've figured out (credibility)
3. Contrarian Takes — What others get wrong (differentiation)
4. Customer Wins — How users succeed (social proof)
```
